The Commission will soon open a call for proposals under the Digital Europe Programme to support 2 large-scale pilots of cloud-based artificial intelligence systems for medical imaging, for a total of EUR 9 million in EU funding. The call will open on 21 April 2026 and close on 1 October 2026. The pilots will focus on healthcare settings where AI can assist the analysis of imaging data - including MRI, CT, X-ray, PET and ultrasound - by flagging findings for review by qualified medical professionals. The pilots aim to: improve efficiency in detection and diagnostic workflows support prioritisation of critical cases reduce pressure on radiology services contribute to more equitable access to screening services, including in underserved regions Medical centres participating in the pilots will also join the European Network of AI-Powered Advanced Screening Centres, ensuring that practical experience informs the wider European community. Results will be shared through Network events, enabling peer learning and the dissemination of good practice. The pilots will build on existing European infrastructures, including Cancer Image Europe and HealthData@EU, to strengthen collaboration and accelerate the adoption of AI in healthcare across Europe. Access the Funding & Tenders Portal for more information and to apply to the call for proposals.
